AndroidScheme
=============

This is a buggy, incomplete Scheme interpreter in an Android app.  Run the 
app and you'll get a text field and an eval button.  Tapping the eval
button causes the app to evaluate the Scheme code in the text field and
display the result in the lower part of the screen.

Right now the interpreter supports the following 12 functions and special
forms:

 - quote
 - if
 - set!
 - define (but not the function definition syntax; to define a function
   you must use `(define f (lambda ...))`)
 - lambda
 - begin
 - +
 - *
 - -
 - and
 - <

This is mostly an exercise/proof of concept for myself.
